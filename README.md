dldldl
======

**dldldl** is a simple node utility for syncing your music playlists on various
sites onto your hard drive. Currently it supports YouTube.

It is similar to https://github.com/alltomp3/alltomp3-app, except
**dldldl** is focused on syncing playlists incrementally. Currently it only
has ffmpeg-static as a native dependency.
